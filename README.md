Clocker
=======

Clocker creates and manages a **[Docker](http://docker.io/)** cloud infrastructure. Clocker supports
single-click deployment and runtime management of multi-node applications that can run on
containers distributed across multiple hosts. Plugins are included for both
**[Project Calico](https://github.com/Metaswitch/calico-docker/)** and **[Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/)**
to provide seamless Software-Defined Networking integration. Application blueprints written for
**[Apache Brooklyn](https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/)** can thus be deployed to a distributed
Docker Cloud infrastructure.

This repository contains all of the required Brooklyn entities, locations and examples.

## Getting started

To get started, you just have to download the Clocker distribution archive, deploy one of the
**Docker Cloud** blueprints to the cloud or machines of your choice, and then use Clocker to
deploy your applications. This will automatically create the required Docker containers.

You can create a Docker based cloud infrastructure on your favourite cloud provider or on a 
private cloud using any of the jclouds supported APIs. Alternatively you can target one or 
more existing machines for running Docker.

If you are keen to peek under the covers, you will find the Docker Cloud infrastructure
blueprints at either
[docker-cloud-calico.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/master/examples/src/main/assembly/files/blueprints/docker-cloud-calico.yaml)
or
[docker-cloud-weave.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/master/examples/src/main/assembly/files/blueprints/docker-cloud-weave.yaml)
depending on your choice of SDN provider. 

### Using the latest Clocker release

The latest version of Clocker is [1.1.0-PREVIEW.20150914](https://github.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/releases/tag/v1.1.0-PREVIEW.20150914).
You can deploy your own **Docker Cloud** with a Weave SDN by running these commands with the _network_ argument
st to `weave`, to use Project Calico as your SDN provider, change the last argument to `calico` instead:
```Bash
% wget --no-check-certificate --quiet \
    -O brooklyn-clocker-dist.tar.gz http://git.io/vZyM5
% tar zxf brooklyn-clocker-dist.tar.gz
% cd brooklyn-clocker
% ./bin/clocker.sh location network
```
The _location_ argument specifies the destination to deploy to, and the _network_ argument can be either `calico` or `weave`. If these are omitted then
Brooklyn will start up without running Clocker, and you can choose the application to deploy using the web UI instead.

A Docker image is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/clockercentral/clocker/). You must provide volume sources for a`.brooklyn`
directory that is writeable, and your `.ssh` directory, and if you want to use a different port to 8080 or 8443 they must be forwarded on the host.
A suitable startup command would be:
```Bash
% docker run -d -v ~/.brooklyn:/root/.brooklyn -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -P \
    clockercentral/clocker:1.1.0-PREVIEW.20150914 \
    location network
```
For example, you can specify the jclouds provider for SoftLayer in San Jose by using
_jclouds:softlayer:sjc01_, a group of machines as _byon:(hosts="10.1.2.3,10.1.2.4")_ or a specific
location from your `brooklyn.properties` file as _named:alias_.

For all cloud locations you must first configure the `~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties` file with any
necessary credentials and security details, and select an SSH key (defaulting to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
A basic `brooklyn.properties` file should look like the following:

```
brooklyn.ssh.config.privateKeyFile = ~/.ssh/id_rsa_clocker
brooklyn.ssh.config.publicKeyFile = ~/.ssh/id_rsa_clocker.pub

brooklyn.location.jclouds.softlayer.identity = user.name
brooklyn.location.jclouds.softlayer.credential = softlayersecretapikey
brooklyn.location.named.Softlayer\ California = jclouds:softlayer:sjc01

brooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.identity = ACCESS_KEY
brooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.credential = awssecretkey
brooklyn.location.named.Amazon\ Ireland = jclouds:aws-ec2:eu-west-1
```

For more information on setting up locations, including supplying cloud provider credentials, see the
[_Setting up Locations_ section of Brooklyn Getting Started](https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/quickstart/#configuring-a-location),
and the more detailed [locations guide](https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/v/0.7.0-M1/use/guide/locations/index.html).
The Brooklyn documentation also covers setting up security for the web-console, and configuring users
and passwords.

The Brooklyn web-console, which will be deploying and managing your Docker Cloud, can be accessed at 
[http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) - this URL will have been written to standard out during startup.
A preview of the new Clocker web-console, which shows a summary of the deployed Docker Clouds, is also available on the
same server, at [http://localhost:8081/clocker/](http://localhost:8081/clocker/).

Once the Docker Cloud application has started, a new location named `my-docker-cloud` will be
available in the Locations drop-down list when adding new applications. Simply start a new application in this location
and it will use Docker containers instead of virtual machines.

For more information on deploying applications from the Brooklyn catalog, see
[Getting Started - Policies and Catalogs](https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/quickstart/policies-and-catalogs.html).

You can also paste a YAML blueprint into the _YAML_ tab of the _Add Application_ dialog, as follows:
```JS
location: my-docker-cloud
services:
- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.Tomcat8Server
  wars.root: "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/brooklyn-clocker/hello-world.war"
```

A blueprint for an application using a Docker image would look like this:
```JS
location: my-docker-cloud
services:
- type: docker:redis:2.8.19
  openPorts:
  - 6379
  directPorts:
  - 6379
```

### Building from source

<!-- CLOCKER_VERSION_BELOW -->
The master branch of Clocker is at version [1.1.0-DIFFUSION-5.6.1](http://github.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/).
Build and run this version of Clocker from source as follows:

```Bash
    % git clone https://github.com/brooklyncentral/clocker.git
    ...
    % cd clocker
    % mvn clean install
    ...
    % tar zxf examples/target/brooklyn-clocker-dist.tar.gz
    % cd brooklyn-clocker
    % ./bin/clocker.sh location network
    ...
```

If you just want to test the latest code, then our [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/brooklyncentral/clocker)
build runs for every commit and the resulting distribution files are archived and made available for
download on [Amazon S3](http://clocker-latest.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/).
